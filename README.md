# Computer_Vision_Main
### ðŸ§  Computer_Vision_Main
A comprehensive collection of feature detection and matching algorithms using OpenCV, aimed at exploring key techniques in computer vision such as SIFT, Harris Corner Detection, ORB, and RANSAC. The project visualizes keypoints and feature matches while helping you understand how corner detection and robust transformations work on real-world images.

### ðŸ”§ Algorithms Implemented
ðŸ“Œ 1. SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)
Detects and describes local features in images.
Invariant to scale and rotation.
Produces distinctive and reliable keypoints.

ðŸ“Œ 2. Harris Corner Detection
Identifies corner points where intensity changes in all directions.
Useful for motion detection and tracking.

ðŸ“Œ 3. ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)
Fast and efficient alternative to SIFT and SURF.
Combines FAST keypoint detector and BRIEF descriptor.
Suitable for real-time applications.
