# Computer_Vision_Main
A collection of feature detection and matching algorithms using OpenCV â€“ including SIFT, harries corner detection, and ORB with RANSAC. Visualize keypoints, match features, and understand how corner detection and robust transformations work in computer vision.
ðŸ”§ Algorithms Implemented
SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)
Detects and describes local features in images, scale and rotation invariant.

Harris Corner Detection
Identifies points in the image where the surrounding region shows significant intensity changes in all directions (corners).

ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)
Efficient alternative to SIFT/SURF, suitable for real-time applications.

RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus)
Filters outliers from matches and estimates a robust geometric transformation (like homography or affine transform).
